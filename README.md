# DSA in Java 🚀

This repository contains my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** practice using **Java**.  
Right now I’m building my fundamentals step-by-step before moving to deep DSA topics like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.

## 📚 Current Learning Progress

### ✔ Completed So Far
I have learned and practiced:

#### **1. BasicCheege**  
- Basic Java setup  
- Variables  
- Data types  
- Input/Output  
- Basic exercises  

#### **2. If_Else**  
- Conditional statements  
- Nested conditions  
- Simple decision-making problems  

#### **3. Loops**  
- `for`, `while`, `do-while`  
- Nested loops  
- Pattern basics  
- Repetition logic  

These topics build the foundation for DSA, so I’m making sure they are very strong.
